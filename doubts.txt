1. Can i interpolate temp? I am missing out on 4692-3796 = 896 rows
for loop of CDH and find highest correlation
13th dec was written as 13th july corrected that
-> there is a problem with dec 1-15 data and may 1-15, they both have july 13th data
-> jul 16-30 not being read i guess data is in wrong form?
