1. For some reason few values of e1,e2 and constraints on bills dont work
-> there is a problem with dec 1-15 data and may 1-15, they both have july 13th data
-> jul 16-30 not being read i guess data is in wrong form?
2. for e1,e2 as 3 with contstarits as 1.5 and 0.5 of the bill values I am observing that there is some sort of smoothness in the predictions
